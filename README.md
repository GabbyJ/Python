Learning Python

<p><strong>June 3, Monday</strong></p>
<p>Been learning Javascript but have been forgetting to log it. I've made a left turn a few weeks ago and am learning Python now. I'm seeing what it has to offer and so far, it's cool.</p>
<p>Today I started a 4.5 hr Youtube video and got 2 hrs in. I learned a lot in the few weeks but I'm reinforcing the basics before I get too deep in.</p>
<p>I built a calculator, improved the calculator, then also a Mad Libs game.</p>
<p><strong>June 4, Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>Today I did another 1.5 hrs of the Youtube video. I reinforced while loops, for loops, and dictionaries.</p><p>The new stuff I learned today was try/except, reading, writing, and appending files, and the wonderful world of modules/pip. I'll need to go back to modules to experiment with the many possibilities of that. 
<p>I built a guessing game, an exponent function, and a translator today. I think I will add to these little projects I've been building in the lesson to make them nicer then post them here.</p>
<p><strong>June 5, Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Today I improved my calculator a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>June 6, Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Today I created a guessing game. It has room for improvement, but it's a decent first draft.</p>
<p><strong>June 7, Friday</strong></p>
<p>Today I created a translator to a giraffe language. Yes, I said giraffe. Another a decent first draft.</p>
<p>They say it's better to build something and improve it later than simply not build anything because you don't know enough, so that's what I'm doing.</p>
<p><strong>June 8, Saturday</strong></p>
<p>Today I learned about classes, objects, object functions, inheriting classes, and using python in the terminal. With this new information I created a multiple choice quiz. Once again, a good start, but can be improved.</p>
<p>I've officially finished that Youtube video I started in the beginning of the week. It gave a a lot of useful information.</p>
<p>Think I'm going to focus on project based learning this time and look into projects to do to enforce what I've learned and advance my knowledge through useful situations.</p>
<p><strong>June 9, Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Worked on improving the quiz. I was creating a grading system but got stuck on an unknown problem with my if/else statements.</p>
<p>Rented 3 Javascript books from the library and will get back into that soon as well.</p>
<p><strong>June 10, Monday</strong></p>
<p>Kept working on the grading system today. Not sure what's wrong. Bought 2 Python books today and hopefully they'll help me with this current problem and move me forward overall.</p>
<p>The 2 books I got were <i>Python 3 the Hard Way</i> and <i>Python Crash Course</i>. Hopefully they work well for me.</p>
<p><strong>June 11, Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>As Ice Cube said, today was a good day. I FINALLY figured out the grading system then I also fixed the user input so that it will accept multiple versions of the right answer. Since I was using a class instead of if/else statements, that was a whole adventure in itself. But I figured it out after a lot of googling and experiementing. Tomorrow I will work on showing people their right and wrong answers.</p>
<p>I gave people a link to test out the test and nobody could break it! That's always good. Their feedback was just that they just wanted to know their answers.</p>
<p>My Python books came today too, so that adds to the good day!</p>
<p>I'm quite happy with my progress so far in Python. Makes me not want to go back to Javascipt just yet lol.</p>
<p><strong><i>1:12 AM update (kind of tomorrow, but still today):</i></strong> I read through the first 20 pages of <i>Learn Python 3 the Hard Way</i>. It's quite funny. He talks directly to you and talks back to you because he knows the crazy stuff you're thinking already lol. It  definitely makes the books engaging. Excited to see what I get from it.</p>
<p><strong>June 12, Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Today I successfully added the show answers and play again on my trivia quiz. Both were surprisingly easier than I thought. So to challenge myself more, I decided to create difficulty levels but the play again loop and the difficulty loop don't like each other for some reason. Separately they work though. So that's been my main project today and will be tomorrow. New day, new eyes!</p>
<p><strong>June 13, Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Welp, still stuck on this difficulty loop. I did discover that what I thought yesterday about the loop, isn't what's happening. So that was linear progress I guess... Still don't have a solution though, but there's always tomorrow</p>
<p>Read another 20 pages of my Python book as well.</p>
<p><strong>June 14, Friday</strong></p>
<p>YAYYYYY!!!! I figured out the repeating loop situation! I found the pattern of what changed when I changed little parts of the code and figured out it was simply adding a break and removing an indent. Those dang indents lol. I feel the quiz is pretty complete. I've sent it to some friends to help me test, so we'll see what they come back with.</p>
<p>This satisfying feeling of creating something from nothing is just great! Probably going to start something new tomorrow. Or work on improving one of my earlier basic projects. We'll see!</p>
<p>Update: Added a blocking loop to not allow only blanks, spaces, or numbers. An answer must be given. NOW I think it's finished.</p>

<p><strong><em>2:42 AM(kind of tomorrow, but still today):</em></strong></p>
<p>Welp... losing track of time, my visual streak is officially broken. BUT today in about 5.5 hrs I created hangman without a tutorial. Overall it's finished, but the only reason I didn't finish by midnight was because I decided to create the actual hangman images. Making them and figuring out how to add them in a loop is what I'm working on now. Will finish tomorrow.</p>
<p>I'm very proud of my progress in python so far. Still sad about the visual streak though :(, but oh well</p>
<p><strong>June 16, Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Finished my Hangman in 8 hours! Much quicker than the week it took to finish the Music Trivia Quiz. I'm very proud of my progress so far.</p>
<p>Side note: The simpleness of Python is helping me understand Javascript concepts better. That's a win-win in my book!</p>
<p>I'm waiting on feedback from family and peers, but I'm confident this game is good and fun! The words may be a bit too hard simply from longness, but we'll see. Also note that this isn't just a guess the word game that everyone seems to make. And some call their's hangman when it's just a basic guess the word too. Mine is a full on hangman. Googling around, I wasn't finding any examples of anyone doing this so that was good motivation to create it.</p>
