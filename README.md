Learning Python

<strong>June 3, Monday</strong>
<p>Been learning Javascript but have been forgetting to log it. I've made a left turn a few weeks ago and am learning Python now. I'm seeing what it has to offer and so far, it's cool.</p>
<p>Today I started a 4.5 hr Youtube video and got 2 hrs in. I learned a lot in the few weeks but I'm reinforcing the basics before I get too deep in.</p>
<p>I built a calculator, improved the calculator, then also a Mad Libs game</p>
