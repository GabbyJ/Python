Learning Python

<p><strong>June 3, Monday</strong></p>
<p>Been learning Javascript but have been forgetting to log it. I've made a left turn a few weeks ago and am learning Python now. I'm seeing what it has to offer and so far, it's cool.</p>
<p>Today I started a 4.5 hr Youtube video and got 2 hrs in. I learned a lot in the few weeks but I'm reinforcing the basics before I get too deep in.</p>
<p>I built a calculator, improved the calculator, then also a Mad Libs game</p>
<p><strong>June 4, Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>Today I did another 1.5 hrs of the Youtube video. I reinforced while loops, for loops, and dictionaries.</p><p>The new stuff I learned today was try/except, reading, writing, and appending files, and the wonderful world of modules/pip. I'll need to go back to modules to experiment with the many possibilities of that. 
<p>I built a guessing game, an exponent function, and a translator today. I think I will add to these little projects I've been building in the lesson to make them nicer then post them here.</p>

<p>Today I improved my calculator a bit more</p>
<p><strong>June 6, Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Today I created a guessing game. It has room for improvement, but it's a decent first draft</p>
<p><strong>June 7, Friday</strong></p>
<p>Today I created a translator to a giraffe language. Yes, I said giraffe. Another a decent first draft</p>
<p>They say it's better to build something and improve it later than simply not build anything because you don't know enough, so that's what I'm doing</p>
<p><strong>June 8, Saturday</strong></p>
<p>Today I learned about classes and objects and object functions. With this new information I created a multiple choice quiz. Once again, a good start, but can be improved</p>
